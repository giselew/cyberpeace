Configuration
=============

This section talks about TypoScript configuration.

The TypoScript options can be set in the Constant editor or as TypoScript-Setup. 
In TypoScript setup there are some additional options (mostly for debugging) which are not present in the constants

We recommend to set up a SysFolder where to store the data (IPs and Log).
