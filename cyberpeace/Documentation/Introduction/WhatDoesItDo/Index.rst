What does it do?
----------------

The extension keeps unwanted clients off the website and helps avoid a cyberwar on the own site.

It uses the live-database by `www.abuseipdb.com <https://www.abuseipdb.com/>`__ * to identify and block IPs known for malicious 
activities such as hacking, spam, excessive crawling.
 
The **IP-blocklist by spamhaus.org** ** completes protection from known IPs which send spam, make hack attemps, attacks etc.

Additionally an own, **manually editeded IP-blacklist** ** allows to block any IP or IP-range.

The extension scans for **spiders, bots and crawlers** as well: If there's no help blocking certain crawlers 
from digging the website using robots.txt, the positiv- or negativlist of CyberPeace allows to manage access

\* Requires a (free-)account at abuseipdb.com

** Requires installation of extension *toctoc_comments*
